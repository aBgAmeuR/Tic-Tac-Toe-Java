## Introduction

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. It is a two-player game, where each player takes turns to place their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA
- JavaFX 11.0.2 or higher
- Scene Builder 11.0.0 or higher

## About the Project

The game is implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The model that contains the game logic. The view that contains the game's GUI. The controller that contains the event handlers for the GUI.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each grid cell is a button. When a player clicks on a button, the player symbol is displayed on the button. The game ends when a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), or when all cells are filled and no player has three in a row. The game can be restarted by clicking the "Play Again" button.

## How to Play

1. Run the application.
2. Add play with your friend.

If you don't have any friends, you can play against a bot. To do this, you just have to go to the settings and change the number of players.

## How to Run
